Imagine that you are a professional software engineer and do the following task:
task = {
i AM TRYING to build a django application, the front end and the backend. The main idea is to have 2 main sections. 

Section 1: There should be a registration and login page for customers. And then when the customer logs in, he can do some database(vector database) activities. 

Section 2: This section is for the clients of the customers above. This is a search operation on the database of the above customers. 

}

I am building a jewellery store search web application. The idea is to create a vector database of jewellery items for the store and when a customer comes with an image of a particular jewel, the application will show similar images.

ChatGPT said:

Got it — you’re essentially describing a Django + vector search application with two user types and an image similarity search feature for jewellery items.
Here’s how I’d proceed as a professional engineer, step-by-step:

1. Clarify Requirements

Before touching code:

User Roles:

Jewellery Store Owner (Customer) – Can register, log in, upload jewellery images, and manage their store’s vector database.

Jewellery Store Visitor (Client) – Can search by uploading an image and see similar jewellery from the store.

Vector Database: Store embeddings of jewellery images.

Similarity Search: When a visitor uploads an image, find top-N most similar items.

2. Choose Tech Stack

Backend: Django (for authentication, API endpoints, and business logic)

Frontend: Django Templates (simple) or React/Vue (for richer UI)

Vector Database: Options:

Milvus / Zilliz Cloud – Scalable, production-ready.

Pinecone – Easy to integrate, managed service.

FAISS – Local, good for MVP.

Embedding Model:

For image search: sentence-transformers or OpenAI CLIP model (e.g., "clip-ViT-B-32").

Storage for Images:

AWS S3 / DigitalOcean Spaces / local MEDIA_ROOT for development.

3. System Architecture
[Frontend UI]  <--->  [Django Views / DRF API]  <--->  [Vector DB]
                           |
                       [PostgreSQL]
                           |
                        [Image Store]


PostgreSQL: Store metadata (item name, price, description, image URL).

Vector DB: Store embeddings and IDs pointing to PostgreSQL records.

Image Store: Actual jewellery images.

4. Implementation Plan
Phase 1 – Setup & Auth

Create a Django project and app structure.

Implement User model with two roles:

Customer (store owner)

Client (store visitor)

Add registration/login/logout for both roles (Django auth or django-allauth).

Phase 2 – Customer Dashboard

Image Upload Form for jewellery items.

When image is uploaded:

Save to image storage.

Generate vector embedding using CLIP.

Store in PostgreSQL (metadata) and Vector DB (embedding + item ID).

List & delete jewellery items.

Phase 3 – Client Search

Create a search page where clients upload an image.

Backend:

Generate embedding of uploaded image.

Query Vector DB for top N matches.

Fetch matching jewellery metadata from PostgreSQL.

Display results (with image thumbnails, name, price).

Phase 4 – Optimizations

Add store filtering so each client only searches in a particular store.

Enable pagination and relevance scores.

Add caching for popular searches.

5. Example Workflow

Customer logs in → uploads 50 jewellery images → embeddings stored in Vector DB.

Client visits store’s search page → uploads image of a necklace → app finds and returns similar necklaces from that store’s collection.

6. Deployment

Use Docker for environment consistency.

Deploy Django + Postgres + Milvus with Docker Compose.

Host images on S3 for scalability.

Optional: use NGINX + Gunicorn for production.

If you want, I can give you a code skeleton that sets up:

Django project with user roles

File upload endpoint

Image → embedding → vector DB storage

Search endpoint

That would jumpstart your jewellery search web app in a structured way.

1️⃣ accounts

Purpose: Handle user authentication & profiles

Models:

Customer (extends User)

Optional Client (if clients need accounts)

Views:

Registration, login, logout

Profile management

Templates:

register.html, login.html, profile.html

2️⃣ jewellery

Purpose: Manage jewellery items (CRUD)

Models:

Jewellery

Views:

Add, update, delete jewellery

List jewellery for the customer

Templates:

add_jewellery.html, list_jewellery.html, edit_jewellery.html

3️⃣ search

Purpose: Handle image similarity search for clients

Models:

No new models (embeddings stored in vector DB)

Views:

Search page (upload image → show similar items)

Templates:

search.html, results.html

Optional 4️⃣ logs

Track customer and client actions

Could be part of core or separate logs app

Model: Log(user, action, timestamp)

✅ Advantages of modular approach:

Each app has clear responsibilities → easier to maintain

Easier to add new features later

Can be reused in other projects

If you want, I can draw a modular folder structure for your Django project showing apps, models, views, and templates. This will give you a ready-to-implement blueprint. Do you want me to do that next?

4 tables in the SQLite.

2 tables in accounts:
  i) owner table -- which includes registration details and username and password --using the username and password he logs in and does the crud operations on jewellery images of the store
  ii) customer table -- includes a mandatory email, id[pk] name mandatory, optional phone number, optional address
1 table in jewellery:
  i)jewellery table -- should have (id[pk], name, price, category, vector_id, description, image_url)
1 table in logs: 
  i) logs--(id, category, count) -- the id here is same id as customer table id. its the foreign key 


| Table     | Field      | Relationship     | Notes                        |
| --------- | ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Owner     | username   | built-in         | login + CRUD for jewellery   |
| Customer  | id         | PK               | end users                    |
| Jewellery | owner      | FK → Owner       | owner can upload many items  |
| Jewellery | vector\_id | stores vector DB | for image similarity search  |
| Log       | id         | FK → Customer    | tracks activity per customer |
